# Phishing for Significance
For our DATASCI W241 class, my group and I were concerned about whether cybersecurity training could be improved so that less students would be victims of online recruitment fraud. At the time this project occurred, there was no cybersecurity training that was provided to the students, and the university only offered "Fight the Phish" posters which we had to search for ourselves. We created a survey where we tested whether having interactive cybersecurity training, as compared to training where which only requires reading, would increase the accuracy rate of identification rate of phishing emails that are targeted to students.

While this was originally done in conjunction with Angelique Agho and Srila Maiti, most of the Qualtrics programming, R code, and writing is mine.
