# LA Traffic Collisions
Vision Zero's goal is to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Los Angeles is infamous for its traffic and high speed highway chases, and it adopted Vision Zero in 2015. Using LA City's Traffic Collision data, I did some exploratory data analysis on the success of Vision Zero.

While this was originally a group project by Ben Meier, Rebecca Sun, and me for our DATASCI W200 class together, I redid the writing and the code to be mine.

Language: Python<br>
Python Libraries: MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas, Folium<br>
Statistics: Summary statistics
