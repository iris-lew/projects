			<div class="grid-item">LA Traffic Collisions</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				Vision Zero's goal is to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries.
				Los Angeles is infamous for its traffic and high speed highway chases, and it adopted Vision Zero in 2015.
				Using LA City's Traffic Collision data, I did some exploratory data analysis on the success
				of Vision Zero.
				<br><br>
				While this was originally a group project by Ben Meier, Rebecca Sun, and I for our
				DATASCI W200 class together, I redid the writing and the code to be mine.

				Python Libraries: MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas, Folium<br>

			<div class="grid-item">Phishing for Significance</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				For our DATASCI W241 class, 
				my group and I were concerned about whether cybersecurity training could be improved so that less students would 
				be victims of online recruitment fraud. 
				At the time this project occurred, there was no cybersecurity training that was provided to the students,
				and the university only offered "Fight the Phish" posters which we had to search for ourselves.
				We created a survey where we tested whether having interactive cybersecurity training, 
				as compared to training where which only requires reading, 
				would increase the accuracy rate of identification rate of phishing emails that are targeted to students.
				<br><br>
				While this was originally done in conjunction with Angelique Agho and Srila Maiti,
				most of the Qualtrics programming, R code, and writing is mine.

			<div class="grid-item">LinkedIn Recommendations in a Word Cloud</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				I've previously used Word Clouds through my work, so I was interested in exploring 
				how they functioned for myself through R and Tableau. 
				Additionally, I wanted to see if there were any common words that 
				people used to describe in their recommendations on LinkedIn so I combined these two desires.
				<br><br>
				The coding and write up was done by me.

			<h2>Coaching</h2>
			<p2><b>Introduction to Tableau | Hanover Research</b><br>
				I designed a Tableau training and piloted a demonstration of the training to both survey 
				and secondary research staff members. 
				This training focused on teaching staff members to create various different graphs (e.g., bar graphs, likert scales, 
				NPS scales), 
				to understand how Tableau reads the data, and how to manipulate data to get it in the desired format for Tableau.</p2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p2><b>Introduction to R | Hanover Research</b><br>
				I designed and administered an R training that was targeted to survey researchers and I 
				later adapted this to fit secondary researchers too. 
				This training encompassed the topics of set up, vocabulary, if-statements, for loops, and while loops.

				Iris is an amazing mentor. 
				She is so smart and successful yet she is so down to earth, funny, and just straight out friendly! 
				She is very knowledgeable about everything that you need to know about psych major,
