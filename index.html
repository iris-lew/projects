			<div class="grid-item">Do English Language Learners Write Like Published Authors?</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				For our DATASCI W266 (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning) class,
				Srila and I examined whether the performance of BERT models could be improved in scoring 
				essays written by English Language Learners (ELLs).
				Prior studies suggest that the pre-trained data (Google BooksCorpus and Wikipedia) 
				of BERT was unsuited for automatic essay scoring,
				thus we decided to experiment with unfreezing the pretrained layers of BERT-base-cased and BERTweet-base.
				We decided to also experiment with BERTweet because it is pretrained on Tweets,
				and we are hoping that its informal nature will be more reminiscent of student writing.
				We find that depending less on the pretraining weights (with more layers unfrozen) 
				provided more accurate predictions but BERT-base-cased outperformed BERTweet-base suggesting that
				student essays belonged to a different population than Tweets.
				<br><br>
				Srila wrote the majority of the code while I did the background research, piecing the code together,
				and the writing.

				<div class="grid-item">Phishing for Significance</div>
				<div class="grid-item">
					For our DATASCI W241 (Experiments and Causal Inference) class, 
					my group and I were concerned about whether cybersecurity training could be improved so that less students would 
					be victims of online recruitment fraud. 
					At the time this project occurred, there was no cybersecurity training that was provided to the students,
					and the university only offered "Fight the Phish" posters which we had to search for ourselves.
					We created a survey where we tested whether having interactive cybersecurity training, 
					as compared to training where which only requires reading, 
					would increase the accuracy rate of identification rate of phishing emails that are targeted to students.
					<br><br>
					While this was originally done in conjunction with Angelique Agho and Srila Maiti,
					most of the Qualtrics programming, R code, and writing is mine.

			<div class="grid-item">LA Traffic Collisions</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				Vision Zero's goal is to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries.
				Los Angeles is infamous for its traffic and high speed highway chases, and it adopted Vision Zero in 2015.
				Using LA City's Traffic Collision data, I did some exploratory data analysis on the success
				of Vision Zero.
				<br><br>
				While this was originally a group project by Ben Meier, Rebecca Sun, and I for our
				DATASCI W200 class together, I redid the writing and the code to be mine.
				<br><br>
				<i>Update (Nov 10, 2024):</i>I updated this analysis to include a regression discontinuity design.
				The regression discontinuity design evaluates the effect of Vision Zero as well as the Covid-19 pandemic
				on the number of collisions, the number of victims, and the number of collisions where there were severe or fatal injuries
				recorded.

				I've previously used Word Clouds through my work, so I was interested in exploring 
				how they functioned for myself through R and Tableau. 
				Additionally, I wanted to see if there were any common words that 
				people used to describe in their recommendations on LinkedIn so I combined these two desires.

			<div class="grid-item">Identifying Bad Datasets</div>
			<div class="grid-item">
				Online forums recognize that they are a treasure trove for data mining as their data is used to train models, 
				and companies have taken to paywalling API access to them, most notably Reddit and X (formerly Twitter).
				So why is training data valuable? I dive into what happens to a model when it attempts to answer a 
				particular question where the training data isn't the best, but is publicly available. It is also a lesson 
				in critical thinking with data, and why we can't take promises at their face value.
				<br><br>
				I use two wildfire datasets taken from Kaggle in this write up. I originally used these datasets in my graduate program 
				as part of a group project, and am reusing some of the code from that project in the write up. The chunks
				that are not from my code are denoted.
